Such a path\nmatches the final node but only if its direct parent nodes are the\nother nodes mentioned. A `*` in such a path matches any parent,\nbut only a single level—wildcards that match multiple parents\naren't supported, both for efficiency reasons and because Lezer\ntrees make it rather hard to reason about what they would match.)\n\nA path can be ended with `/...` to indicate that the tag assigned\nto the node should also apply to all child nodes, even if they\nmatch their own style (by default, only the innermost style is\nused).\n\nWhen a path ends in `!`, as in `Attribute!`, no further matching\nhappens for the node's child nodes, and the entire node gets the\ngiven style.\n\nIn this notation, node names that contain `/`, `!`, `*`, or `...`\nmust be quoted as JSON strings.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\nparser.withProps(\n  styleTags({\n    // Style Number and BigNumber nodes\n    \"Number BigNumber\": tags.number,\n    // Style Escape nodes whose parent is String\n    \"String/Escape\": tags.escape,\n    // Style anything inside Attributes nodes\n    \"Attributes!\": tags.meta,\n    // Add a style to all content inside Italic nodes\n    \"Italic/...\": tags.emphasis,\n    // Style InvalidString nodes as both `string` and `invalid`\n    \"InvalidString\": [tags.string, tags.invalid],\n    // Style the node named \"/\" as punctuation\n    '\"/\"': tags.punctuation\n  })\n)\n```\n*/\nfunction styleTags(spec) {\n    let byName = Object.create(null);\n    for (let prop in spec) {\n        let tags = spec[prop];\n        if (!Array.isArray(tags))\n            tags = [tags];\n        for (let part of prop.split(\" \"))\n            if (part) {\n                let pieces = [], mode = 2 /* Normal */, rest = part;\n                for (let pos = 0;;) {\n                    if (rest == \"...\" && pos > 0 && pos + 3 == part.length) {\n                        mode = 1 /* Inherit */;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                    let m = /^\"(?:[^\"\\\\]|\\\\.)*?\"|[^\\/!]+/.exec(rest);\n                    if (!m)\n                        throw new RangeError(\"Invalid path: \" + part);\n                    pieces.push(m[0] == \"*\" ? \"\" : m[0][0] == '\"' ?
